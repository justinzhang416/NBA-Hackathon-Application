Code for 2017 NBA Hackathon Application

Questions:
#1) REQUIRED: After the Golden State Warriors acquired former MVP Kevin Durant in 2016, some NBA fans speculated that the Warriors would not lose consecutive games at any point of the season.*

a) If you wanted to determine the probability that this prediction would be true (i.e., that the Warriors would never lose consecutive games at any point during an 82-game season), what is one approach
(or a few approaches) you may use to solve the problem? What answer do you get? Exact answers are of course welcome, but approaches that lead to approximations (and those approximations) are fine, too 
(please specify the precision of your estimate). Assume the Warriors have an 80% chance of winning each individual game.

b) So, would you have agreed with that hypothesis?

c) Finally, at least what % of a team's games would a team need to be expected to win (assuming that win probability stays constant from game to game) for there to be a greater than 50% chance that the 
team never suffers consecutive losses at any point in the season?

#2) BONUS: When are teams eliminated from playoff contention? Using the results for the 2016-17 regular season as a test case for your quantitative solution, please generate the date that each team was
eliminated from playoff contention. We are purely looking for a date when a team was eliminated from playoff consideration, not any specific seed. Please note that your solution should generate the dates
automatically, and should use code-based or Excel-based tools. To aid your work, click on this LINK for a .pdf file of the NBA Tiebreaker rules and an .xlsx file with the following three tabs 1) Divisions 
for the 2016-17 Season, 2) The game results for the 2016-17 NBA Regular Season, 3) A sample that includes the correct formatting for your final submission. Please note that teams that qualified for the 
playoffs should be labeled "Playoffs" and the date a team is eliminated should be reported in text format, not Excel Date format.
